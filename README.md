# 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Ridge Regression

This repository contains the code and details for my summer training project, where I developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various housing features. The project involves extensive data preprocessing, outlier detection, and predictive modeling using Ridge Regression.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Objective**: To predict house prices (in lakhs) using features such as square footage, BHK count, and location attributes.
- **Dataset**: A housing price dataset including both numerical and categorical features.

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Ridge Regression, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, ColumnTransformer)
  - **Outlier Detection**: Z-score, Interquartile Range (IQR), Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
  - **Missing Data Visualization**: Missingno

## 🛠️ Steps Involved

### 1. Data Exploration
- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand the distribution of features and target variables.
- Identified the types of data (numerical vs. categorical) and checked for imbalances in the target variable.

### 2. Outlier Detection and Treatment
- Used statistical techniques like Z-score and IQR to detect outliers in numerical data.
- Applied Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to identify potential anomalies.
- Treated outliers by capping and replacing them with median values to minimize their impact on the model.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using various techniques, including imputation and visualization with heatmaps and bar plots.
- Separated numerical and categorical features and applied appropriate transformations using StandardScaler and OneHotEncoder.

### 4. Model Building
- Built a Ridge Regression model after splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Used a pipeline for efficient data transformation and model training.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).
- Compared the model's performance on both training and testing datasets to ensure generalization.

## 📈 Results
- Achieved promising results with an R² score of **[Insert R² Score]**, indicating a good fit for predicting house prices.
- The model's evaluation showed **[Insert relevant metric values]**, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## 💡 Key Learnings
- The importance of thorough data preprocessing, especially in dealing with outliers and missing data.
- How Ridge Regression can help mitigate overfitting in predictive models by imposing a penalty on large coefficients.
- Practical experience with scikit-learn's pipeline and column transformer for streamlined machine learning workflows.

## 🌟 Next Steps
- Explore other regression techniques, such as Lasso Regression and ElasticNet, to compare their performance with Ridge Regression.
- Further optimization and feature engineering to enhance model accuracy.
