# -Summer-Training-Project-House-Price-Prediction-Using-Ridge-Regression
I'm excited to share the culmination of my summer training project, where I developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on a dataset of housing features. This project involved extensive data preprocessing, outlier detection, and building a predictive model using Ridge Regression.
Project Overview
Objective: The goal was to predict house prices (in lakhs) using various features like square footage, BHK count, and location attributes.
Dataset: I used a dataset of housing prices, which included both numerical and categorical features.
